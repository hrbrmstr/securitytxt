Description: When security risks in web services are discovered by independent
   security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they
   often lack the channels to properly disclose them. As a result,
   security issues may be left unreported. The 'security.txt' 'Web Security Policies'
   specification defines an 'IETF' draft standard <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-00>
   to help organizations define the process for security researchers to securely 
   disclose security vulnerabilities. Tools are provided to help identify and 
   parse 'security.txt' files to enable analysis of the usage and adoption of these policies.
