Description: When security risks in web services are discovered by independent
   security researchers who understand the severity of the risk, they
   often lack the channels to properly disclose them. As a result,
   security issues may be left unreported. The 'security.txt' 'Web Security Policies'
   specification defines a 'IETF' standard to help organizations define the process 
   for security researchers to securely disclose security vulnerabilities. Tools are
   provided to help identify and parse 'security.txt' files to enable analysis of 
   the usage of these policies.
